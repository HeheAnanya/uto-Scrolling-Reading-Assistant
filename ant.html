        <p>Name the smallest insect you have seen, and the wisest. Is
            it the fly? No, it isn’t. Is it the mosquito? No, not the
            mosquito. Then it must be the worm. No, none of these. It
            is the <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">ant</span></u>—the commonest, the smallest but the wisest
            insect. The story of an ant’s life sounds almost untrue. But people have kept ants as pets, and have watched their daily behaviour closely. So we know a number of facts about
            this tiny, hard-working and intelligent creature.
            An ant uses its feelers or antennae to ‘talk’ to other
            ants by passing messages through them. Watch a row of
            ants moving up or down the wall. Each ant greets all the
            others coming from the opposite direction by touching There are many kinds of ants. The commonest among
            them are the black or red ones. We have seen them since
            we were children, but haven’t paid enough attention to
            them. Where do they live? In their comfortable homes called ‘nests’ or ‘anthills’. Each has hundreds of little rooms and passages. In some of these  rooms the queen ant lays eggs. Others are nurseries for the young ones
            (called ‘grubs’). Workers have their  reserved quarters. They spend most of their time searching
            for food. Some rooms serve as storehouses for this food.
            Soldiers have separate barracks. No worker has ever tried
            to live in a soldier’s house; no soldier has ever gone out
            searching for food. No worker or soldier or cleaner has ever
            harmed a grub. So you see, an ant’s life is very peaceful.
            Each does its share of work intelligently and bravely, and
            never fights with other members of the group.
