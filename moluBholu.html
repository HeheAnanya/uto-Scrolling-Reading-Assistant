            <pre style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">        High up in an icy lair
        Lived a little polar bear
        Snow white, snow bright was her mane,
        Malu Bhalu was her name.
        Very soon our Malu Bhalu
        Learnt the things her parents knew.
        Fish to catch, big and small...
        Malu was a clever girl.
        Malu said to her mother one day:
        Ma, I’m going far out to play.
        I want to see the things that lie
        There beyond the big blue sky.
        A little patience, child, said Mum,
        In the summer when next it comes.
        Summer?... Patience?... What a test!
        Malu simply could not rest.
        First things first! Malu’s mum
        Clasped Malu tight within her arms.
        Then she said — her voice was firm
        Now my dear you’ll have to swim.
        But Ma! said Malu, what do I know?
        How will I? I’ve never swum before!
        Don’t worry dear, said Malu’s mother,
        Do as I do, that’s all, she advised her.
        She had no choice, no other way,
        Malu had to swim that day.
        Tight she gripped her mother’s hand,
        Into the water splash! to land.
        Brave mother’s brave young daughter!
        Doubt and fear she left behind her.
        Malu swam with all her might,
        It didn't matter wrong or right.
        But swimming came so naturally,
        Her mother knew this and all could see.
        Fearless was Malu, this she knew,
        Not just brave, but special too.
