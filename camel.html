        <p>
            IN the beginning, when the world was new and the Animals were just
            beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he lived in the
            middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work. He ate
            sticks and thorns and prickles, and when anybody spoke to him he
            said “Humph!” Just <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Humph!”</span></u> and no more.
            Presently the Horse came to
            him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his back and said,
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Camel, O Camel, come out and
            trot like the rest of us.”
            “Humph!”</span></u> said the Camel, and
            the Horse went away and told the
            Man.
            Presently the Dog came to him,
            with a stick in his mouth, and said,<u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.”
            “Humph!”</span></u> said the Camel, and the Dog went away and told
            the Man.
            Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck, and
            said, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.”
            “Humph!”</span></u> said the Camel, and the Ox went away and told
            the Man.
            At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and
            the Ox together, and said, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Three, O Three, I’m very sorry for you; but that Humph-thing in the Desert can’t
            work, or he would have
            been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and you must
            work double-time to make up for it.”</span></u>
            That made the Three very angry, and they held a panchayat on
            the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing cud and laughed
            at them. Then he said <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Humph!”</span></u> and went away again.
            Presently there came along the Djinn who was in charge of All
            Deserts, rolling in a cloud of dust. “Djinn of All Deserts,” said the Horse, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“is it right for anyone
            to be idle?”</span></u>
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Certainly not,”</span></u> the Djinn.
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Well,”</span></u> said the Horse, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“there’s a thing in the middle of your
            Desert with a long neck and long legs, and he hasn’t done a stroke
            of work since Monday morning. He won’t trot.”
            “Whew!”</span></u> said the Djinn whistling, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“that’s my Camel. What does
            he say about it?”
            “He says ‘Humph!’, and he won’t plough,”</span></u> said the Ox.
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Very good,”</span></u> said the Djinn. <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“I’ll humph him if you will kindly
            wait a minute.”</span></u> The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a walk
            across the Desert, and found the Camel looking at his own reflection
            in a pool of water.
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“My friend,” said the Djinn, “what’s this I hear of your doing
            no work?”</span></u>
            The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, while the Camel
            looked at his own reflection in the pool of water.
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“You’ve given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning,
            all on account of your idleness,”</span></u> said the Djinn. And he went on
            thinking with his chin in his hand. <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Humph!” said the Camel.
            “I shouldn’t say that again if I were you,”</span></u> said the Djinn; <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“you
            might say it once too often. I want you to work.”</span></u>
            And the Camel said <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Humph!”</span></u> again; but no sooner had he said
            it than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and
            puffing up into a great big hump.
            <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“Do you see that?”</span></u> said the Djinn. <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">‘‘That’s your very own humph
            that you’ve brought upon your very own self by not working. Today
            is Thursday, and you’ve done no work since Monday, when the
            work began. Now you are going to work.”
            “How can I,”</span></u> said the Camel, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“with this humph on my back?”
            ‘‘That has a purpose,”</span></u> said the Djinn, <u><span style="font-style: oblique;">“all because you missed
            those three days. You will be able to work now for three days without
            eating, because you can live on your humph; and don’t you ever
            say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to
            the Three, and behave.”</span></u>
            And the Camel went away to join the Three. And from that day
            to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it ‘hump’ now, not
            to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of
            the world, and he has
            never yet learned how to behave. </p>
