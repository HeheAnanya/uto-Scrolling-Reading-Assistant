    <div class="content">
        <p>THERE was once a lady who lived in an old manor-house on
            the border of a big forest. This lady had a pet bear she was
            very fond of. It had been found in the forest, half dead of
            hunger, so small and helpless that it had to be brought up
            on the bottle by the lady and the old cook. This was several
            years ago and now it had grown up to a big bear, so big
            and strong that he could have slain a cow and carried it
            away between his two paws if he had wanted to. But he did
            not want to; he was a most amiable bear who did not dream
            of harming anybody, man or beast. He used to sit outside
            his kennel and look with his small intelligent eyes most
            amicably at the cattle grazing in the field near by. The three
            shaggy mountain ponies in the stable knew him well and
            did not mind in the least when he shuffled into the stable
            with his mistress. The children used to ride on his back
            and had more than once been found asleep in his kennel
            between his two paws. The three dogs loved to play all sorts
            of games with him, pull his ears and his stump of a tail and tease him in every way, but he did not mind it in the
            least. He had never tasted meat; he ate the same food as
            the dogs and often out of the same plate—bread, porridge,
            potato, cabbage, turnip. He had a fine appetite, and his
            friend, the cook, saw to it that he got his fill. Bears are
            vegetarians if they have a chance, and fruit is what they
            like best. In the autumn he used to sit and look with wistful
            eyes at the ripening apples in the orchard, and in his young
            days he had been sometimes unable to resist the temptation
            to climb the tree and help himself to a handful of them.
            Bears look clumsy and slow in their movements, but try a
            bear with an apple tree and you will soon find out that he
            can easily beat any school boy at that game. Now he had
            learnt that it was against the law, but he kept his small
            eyes wide open for any apples that fell to the ground. There
            had also been some difficulties about the beehives; he had
            been punished for this by being put on the chain for two
            days with a bleeding nose and he had never done it again.
            Otherwise he was never put on the chain except for the night and quite rightly so, for a bear, like a dog, is apt to get
            somewhat ill-tempered if kept on the chain, and
            no wonder. He was also put on the chain on Sundays when his
            mistress went to spend the afternoon with her married sister
            who lived in a solitary house on the other side of the
            mountain-lake, a good hour’s walk through the dense
            forest. It was not supposed to be good for him to wander
            about in the forest with all its temptations; it was better to
            be on the safe side. He was also a bad sailor and had once
            taken such a fright at a sudden gust of wind that he had
            upset the boat and he and his mistress had to swim to the
            shore. Now he knew quite well what it meant when his
            mistress put him on the chain on Sundays, with a friendly
            tap on his head and the promise of an apple on her return
            if he had been good during her absence. He was sorry but
            resigned, like a good dog, when his mistress tells him he
            cannot come with her for a walk.
            One Sunday when the lady had chained him up as usual
            and was about half-way through the forest, she suddenly
            thought she heard the cracking of a tree-branch on the
            winding footpath behind her. She looked back and was
            horrified to see the bear coming along full speed. Bears
            look as if they move along quite slowly but they shuffle
            along much faster than a trotting horse. In a minute he
            had joined her, panting and sniffing, to take up his usual place, dog-fashion, at her heels. The lady was very angry,
            she was already late for lunch, there was no time to take
            him back home, she did not want him to come with her,
            and, besides, it was very naughty of him to have disobeyed
            her. She told him in her severest voice to go back at once,
            menacing him with her parasol. He stopped a moment and
            looked at her with his cunning eyes, but did not want to go
            back and kept on sniffing at her. When the lady saw that
            he had even lost his new collar, she got still more angry
            and hit him on the nose with her parasol so hard that it
            broke in two. He stopped again, shook his head and opened
            his big mouth several times as if he wanted to say
            something. Then he turned round and began to shuffle back the way he had come stopping now and then to look
            at the lady till at last she lost sight of him.
            When the lady came home in the evening, the bear was
            sitting in his usual place outside his kennel looking very
            sorry for himself. The lady was still very angry. She went
            up to him and began to scold him most severely and said
            he would have to be chained for two more days. The old
            cook who loved the bear as if he had been her son rushed
            out from the kitchen very angry.
            “What are you scolding him for, missus,” said the cook;
            “he has been as good as gold the whole day, bless him! He
            has been sitting here quite still on his haunches as meek
            as an angel, looking the whole time towards the gate for
            you to come back.”</p>
